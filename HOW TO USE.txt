3) Start Login.exe and fill the program requestes with the Telegram verification code
[After use Login.exe succesfully the program create a sessions file in a sessions folder]

4) Start Export.exe to export member list from public group
[Formatting Link rule: if the link is t.me/EXEMPLELINK we write in the program only EXEMPLELINK without t.me/ ]

5) Now you can Start Adder.exe and follow the instructions to add members to your own group
[Is't possible to add members in a channel but you can revocate the permissions in your group to build it like a channel, so that only you can write in it, the rules about link format are the same of part 4]

+ ADVICE:
if you have just created the telegram account wait about 7 days before adding it to sessions.txt to make it work, otherwise it will be easily banned
